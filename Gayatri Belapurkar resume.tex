\section{Projects}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item {\bf Smart Subsidy System using blockchain}
  
  This project was my entry for Smart India Hackathon 2019 for creating a digital subsidy system using blockchain technology to ensure that the subsidies are received by the true beneficiaries. This project reduced the tracks the application at every stage, reduces the time delays, reduces fraud involved in subsidy distribution and ensures that the records are immutable. As a part of project implementation, I used Ionic framework for hybrid mobile application development and  Solidity for blockchain.
  \item {\bf IoT based Street Quality Identification}
  
  This project is an IoT based solution for measuring of Street Quality by identifying and mapping potholes on the street. I worked in a team of 4 for implementing the project and used a 6 axes accelerometer along with NodeMCU for measuring the vibrations, and GPS module neo6mv2 with Raspberry Pi for mapping the these vibrations to location co-ordinates. The data from this setup was sent to Google Firebase and we used Smooth Z-score algorithm which gave a dynamic threshold which was used for identification of pothole from the data collected from the accelerometer. The web interface, built using Django (Python), displayed the details of the potholes and street quality on a color coded map. This was a completely wireless and a pluggable setup which made it easy to plug and play on any vehicle.
  \item {\bf IoT based detection of public toilet usage and incentivization}
  
  This project was aimed towards detection of usage of public toilets and provide incentives to individuals who use them, thus developing a good hygiene habit. I worked in a team of 4 for implementing this project. The system used a proximity sensor to detect the occupancy of a toilet stall/booth, a turbidity sensor which detected the actual human waste in the toilet and a finger print sensor to identify an individual. These sensors were connected to Raspberry Pi which sent data to Google Firebase and incentives were provided to individuals based on parameters such as consistent daily usage of these public toilets. This data was also available through a mobile application developed using React Native. 
   \item {\bf Asset Management System}
  
  This project was aimed towards solving the problem of laboratory supplies management in colleges by facilitating allocation, purchases and inter-departmental transfers of assets such as monitors, processors, project supplies, etc. I worked in a team of 5 to implement this project using Laravel framework for PHP and SQL for database.
  \item {\bf Blockchain based connectivity for content providers and users for education}
  
  This project was based on the idea of connecting tutors to students using Blockchain for keeping the records related to users and content providers safe and secure and generate certificates which can be stored securely. The implementation of this project was mainly in Laravel framework for PHP and used Python for prototyping Blockchain.

  \section{Internships}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item {\bf Software Development Internship},  AppStack \hfill Jun 2018 - Oct 2018
    
    Worked as an intern with AppStack, a Canada based startup, for Android and iOS application development. My primary project was development of a mobile application which allowed users to post images of photos of food dishes along with its recipes. I was responsible for designing the software architecture of the application, the end to end user experience, implementation and testing of the project. During course of the internship, I used React Native for mobile application development and Google Firebase for database.
    \item {\bf Winter Internship}, VESIT \hfill Dec 2017 - Jan 2018
    
    Worked as an intern on developing staff attendance module in VESIT Content Management System. During the internship, I  focused primarily on developing attendance synchronization and data transfer of records between the biometric attendance module and server using Java for backend and MySQL for database.
